#Arithmetic expression evaluation

This is an arithmetic expression evaluation using stacks and trees, it was a part of a project at university, for applying what we have learned in Algorithmecs and Data structers.

## Usage

Compile the project, then execute it and enter an arithmitic expression that doesn't contain spacecs.

## TODO

1. Add make file.
2. Improve the syntaxic and sementic evaluation.
3. Add spaces deletion, to accept any expression.
