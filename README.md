#Arithmetic expression evaluation

This is an arithmetic expression evaluation using stacks and trees, it was a part of a project at university, for applying what we have learned in Algorithmes and Data structures.

## Usage

Compile the project, then execute it and enter an arithmetic expression that doesn't contain spaces.

## TODO

1. Add make file.
2. Improve the syntactic and semantic evaluation.
3. Add spaces deletion, to accept any expression.
